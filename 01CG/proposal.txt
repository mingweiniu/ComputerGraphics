#Title
    Implementation of polygonal-light shading with linearly transformed matrix from paper,
    "Real-Time Polygonal-Light Shading with Linearly Transformed Cosines"

#Goal/motivation
    "Real-Time Polygonal-Light Shading with Linearly Transformed Cosines" already released the concept 
of using matrix to approximate GGX algorithm due to difficulty of intergration with spherical equations 
and complexity scene.
    Our mainly motivation is that this algorithm improves the performance effectively and the implementation of 
square shape light source with roughness type varing. Thus, we want to implement several shape 
polygonal-light shading with linearly transformed matrix. Further, we wish to modify the matrix with more
type such as anisotropy and anisotropy.

#Related work/background
    at least understanding BRDF, GGX, Ray Tracing and few math tools, Jacobin, Linear algebra and so on.

#Proposed method
    We need to use matrix operations to approximate the GGX by adjusting parameter of diagonals and make this 
into render pipeline in process or shader. Hence we will use several libraries to achieve this.

#Expected results (things that will and might work)
   Demonstrating polygonal-light with multi-shape in a scene.
